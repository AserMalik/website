#Website

##What is this?

This is my website that I built using CodeSandbox IDE and React.JS

##What's the point of using React here?

I used React as a learning exercise. Is it an optimal use of the framework? No. Could I just have used Pug or raw HTML? Yes. Is there any benefit to using React here? Yes, as a play-test to stretch some React muscles.
