## What is this?

This is my personal website that I built using CodeSandbox IDE and React.

## What's the point of using React here?

I used React as a learning exercise. Is it an optimal use of the framework? No. Could I just have used Pug or raw HTML? Yes. Is there any benefit to using React here? Yes, as a play-test to stretch some React muscles.

## How long did it take you?

I built the website over the course of around ~1-2 weeks with variable amounts of commitment. In terms of hours, probably too many for what it is but I messed around with a bunch of things I eventually didn't use. I'd say its about 10-20 hours of figuring out what I want to do and problem-solving.

## What would I do differently if I made it again?

Probably not use React, really. Like I mentioned earlier, Pug might've been simpler and more suited to what I needed. However, if I were to use React again, I'd likely use class instead of functional components. There's a lot I could mess around with using lifecycle and state features that would've made tasks easier for myself. At the time of writing, I wasn't well aware of the differences and ran with what was more suited to my original purposes.
